You can find the code on some online repositories e.g. here: https://github.com/taf2/libebb/blob/master/rbtree.h 
and here: https://gitlab.psi.ch/sinqdev/sics/-/blob/master/rbtree.c

- also from ideas from original public domain source code from a 2012 blog post by Julienne Walker:

The original pages that we link to and talk about this are gone.
We used internet archive to retrieve them and saved them here.
